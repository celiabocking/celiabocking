<h1> Hi, I'm Celia :deciduous_tree: :mushroom: :deciduous_tree:</h1>

<p> Since October 2022, I have been learning full-stack web development, mainly Javascript and React, Node.js and Express, PostgreSQL, but also testing with React Testing Library and Cypress, authentication and authorisation with Auth0, and Typescript. <p>

<p> Until February 1st 2023, I was a bootcamper at School of Code. My repos include workshops, hackathons, and my project TRAVEL HERD. Feel free to check them out to see the journey I've been on over the 16-week bootcamp, from not even knowing what an HTML tag was, to full-stack developer! </p>

<p> Before learning to code, I was studying anthropology with no idea what to do as a career. I didn't want to fall into a grad job without any purpose, so it made sense to find something that would be relatively stable and future-proof and allow me to be challenged and continuously progress. That's how  I initially had the idea of being a developer. It felt like a huge leap away from what I am familiar with - I had only studied STEM subjects up until GCSEs, but I decided it was never too late to learn something new, and I shouldn't let my previous areas of education define what I should do next. It turned out to be the best decision I ever made. I got into a fantastic bootcamp, School of Code, and have found a new love of collaborative problem-solving with a perfect balance of creativity and logic. I love building solutions for people and thinking about who they are, what they need, and how they'll use the product, and then experiencing the process of turning these ideas in to real, tangible applications. </p>

<p> While I search for my first developer role, I will be continuing to strengthen and expand my skills. My current plans are to build a mushroom identification app where I have a database of mushrooms, and the user inputs characteristics such as the cap colour, stem colour, gill attachment style, and habitat and is returned the matching mushrooms! (and a disclaimer that external and thorough research should be done before eating anything...). I also plan to collaborate with a friend to build a website in React for a hypothetical restuarant, allowing users to send booking inquiries from the website. </p>

<p> I am determined to hone my skills and push myself even further, and I am particularly enthusiastic about React. I am excited by all the posibilities of what I could build, and I can't wait to uncover new knowledge. </p>.

<h3> My main focuses for now: 

- Advancing my React skills <br>
- Improving Typescript Skills <br>
- Learning React Native <br>
- Practicing and experiencing building solo and collaborative projects <br>
- Looking for a developer role where I can grow and learn in any way - who knows, maybe deep down I prefer the backend, I just don't know it yet. </h3>

<h1> 100 DAYS OF CODE </h1>

d1: First time intro to Javascript which covered some basics of data types, variables, loops, conditions 

d2: Practised these with some more pair-programming, taking turns by pushing and pulling our commits. 

d3: This evening I created and linked html and javascript files containing an if-else statement which used the return of a prompt as its variable.

d4: Today we focused on JS objects and arrays. While practising these I also got the hang of while loops, and brushed up on using simple conditions and functions. 

d5: Made a small start with attempting a javascript rock paper scissors game in pairs, from this I improved my understanding of function parameters and arguments. ~learned how to check if a directory is a git repo in terminal and also how to delete repo 

d6: evisited the ‘password authenticator’ js task and had fun learning with a lot of trial and error. Decided I need more familiarisation with basic JS before I can efficiently problem solve so I started free code camp’s course.

d7: Was very lucky to have help from a friend today who walked me through making a rock paper scissors game with js. I wasn’t doing any problem-solving, but seeing the code and being able to ask questions strengthened my understanding of js in many ways. 

d8: Learned about the DOM and how to work with it, mostly focusing on selecting objects using the querySelector. Also covered appendChild but still a bit unsure of that one

d9: Learned about event listeners and had loads of practice. Began refactoring the rock paper scissors game in the DOM. 

d10: Set Timeout and Set Interval, Fetch, json(), always await the promise!! 

d11: Practised navigating through large objects to select only the required data.

d12: Built a true/false quiz game with a partner that fetches trivia questions from an API.

d13: Learned the array push() method and how to use a for of loop as well as recapping Set Interval.

d14: more practise with fetching data from APIs, eventListeners, and appending items to lists

d15: practised iterating through arrays and modifying each item, then pushing the new value to a new list, also introduced to ux/ui, AGILE

d16: user personas, CSS variables

d17: Focused on UI, learned about wireframing and played around with Figma, also went over CSS specificity

d18: more research into user personas and learned about empathy maps

d19: used the design-thinking skills learned this week to design a landing web page for our imaginary music production bootcamp.

d20: more design-thinking practice by drawing up low and high-fidelity wireframes in Figma for my personal website

d21: Learned about different CSS units and did some more CSS practice on Free Code Camp. 

d22: intro to node.js, express, learning module.exports and require

d23: fs.readFile, fs.writeFile, json.parse, json.stringify

d24: tried to built a REST API with CRUD endpoints, learned to use postman a bit better

d25: learned about middleware 

d26: made much better progress during the hackathon, built an API with endpoints/responses for GET and POST requests 

d27: followed a yt tutorial for building an API that picks out an outfit for you

d28: practised writing responses to get requests by doing hw task

d29: intro to databases, postgreSQL, SELECT, FROM, WHERE

d30: INNER join, LEFT/RIGHTjoin and learning more about relational databases, touched upon one-to-many relationships

d31: connected our relational database (on elephantSQL) to our code. Made queries and tested these in postman. 

d32: learned arrow functions, learned to require an object within a file into a variable in one line, instead of having to use dot notation. researched API versioning.

d33: hackathon, built a phonebook api that handled get and post requests

d34: codewars and recapped routehandling for post and patch requests

d35: mostly relaxed, looked into ESM

d36: Jest expect().toBe() / toEqual / to beFalsy etc

d37: more practse with jest matchers, intro to cypress

d38: codewars, npm supertest

d39: practised testing by writing our own codewar kata. Repeated a week 4 workshop

d40: wrote end to end and integrated tests for an app, then in the evening recompleted old tasks to practise the foundations of what we had been building on over the last two weeks.

d41: more recapping of old task - getting into better habits of console logging and properly reading error messages

d42: watched youtube videos on react, codecademy jsx, more repeating week 4 tasks

d43: intro to react, concept of it being a virtual DOM, jsx, props

d44: use state/hooks, array methods

d45: usestate/hooks

d46: slice, spread operator

d47: hackathon, worked on making a to do app with react. good for understanding whag goes where, how to separate out components.

d48: familiarised myself more with props and use state with youtube vids.

d49: struggled all day trying to make a blog with react, doing instead of watching videos helped me undertsand state a lot better.

d50: introduced to use effect during day and revisited my blog page in evening. got a better understanding of where to put the state and why. 

d51: started the day off with Codewars, then learned about Git branching and the ‘useReducer’ hook.

d52: codewars, more practice with useReducer, learned about React testing library

d53: more React testing, went to code club and did some collaborative react coding in code sandbox and practised and discussed this weeks concepts with other bootcampers

d54: Hackathon friday, built an app in react that generates random cocktail recipes from an API. these are then added where they can later be deleted.

d55: tried to recerate the cocktail app on my own, finding i understand useState more than props

d56: started a React udemy course

d57: start of project week

d58: discussed react component structure

d60: connected front and back end, css, prepared presentation

d61: presented to a panel of judges and celebrated the end of a difficult week

d62: rested after a difficult week !

d63: continued with my Udemy React course. I used to always be confused but the concept of ‘passing down’ props - to me it didnt seem like it was going ‘downwards’ but now i am able to see it in that way.
