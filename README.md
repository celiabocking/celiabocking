<h1> Hi, I'm Celia :deciduous_tree: :mushroom: :deciduous_tree:</h1>

<p> Since October 2022, I have been learning full-stack web development, mainly Javascript and React, Node.js and Express, PostgreSQL, but also testing with React Testing Library and Cypress, authentication and authorisation with Auth0, and Typescript. <p>

<p> Until February 1st 2023, I was a bootcamper at School of Code. My repos include workshops, hackathons, and my project TRAVEL HERD. Feel free to check them out to see the journey I've been on over the 16-week bootcamp, from not even knowing what an HTML tag was, to full-stack developer! </p>

<p> Before learning to code, I was studying anthropology with no idea what to do as a career. I didn't want to fall into a grad job without any purpose, so it made sense to find something that would be relatively stable and future-proof and allow me to be challenged and continuously progress. That's how  I initially had the idea of being a developer. It felt like a huge leap away from what I am familiar with - I had only studied STEM subjects up until GCSEs, but I decided it was never too late to learn something new, and I shouldn't let my previous areas of education define what I should do next. It turned out to be the best decision I ever made. I got into a fantastic bootcamp, School of Code, and have found a new love of collaborative problem-solving with a perfect balance of creativity and logic. I love building solutions for people and thinking about who they are, what they need, and how they'll use the product, and then experiencing the process of turning these ideas in to real, tangible applications. </p>

<p> While I search for my first developer role, I will be continuing to strengthen and expand my skills. My current plans are to build a mushroom identification app where I have a database of mushrooms, and the user inputs characteristics such as the cap colour, stem colour, gill attachment style, and habitat and is returned the matching mushrooms! (and a disclaimer that external and thorough research should be done before eating anything...). I also plan to collaborate with a friend to build a website in React for a hypothetical restuarant, allowing users to send booking inquiries from the website. </p>

<p> I am determined to hone my skills and push myself even further, and I am particularly enthusiastic about React. I am excited by all the posibilities of what I could build, and I can't wait to uncover new knowledge. </p>.

<h3> My main focuses for now: 

- Advancing my React skills <br>
- Improving Typescript Skills <br>
- Learning React Native <br>
- Practicing and experiencing building solo and collaborative projects <br>
- Looking for a developer role where I can grow and learn in any way - who knows, maybe deep down I prefer the backend, I just don't know it yet. </h3>
